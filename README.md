**My first game**

This is my first time using github, so if I did something wrong let me know.

So, for remake the 70's game Pong I used p5.js, a JavaScript library and the assistance of Guilherme Lima's class at Alura, "Lógica de programação: comece em lógica com o jogo Pong e Javascript" where he did the step by step how to do it. I've learn a lot doing this game, how to search for references and construct things from zero were the most used during the course.
